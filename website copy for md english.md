**KNOW YOUR RIGHTS**

**OUTSIDE IN PUBLIC/AT WORK:**

* You have the right to remain silent. You may refuse to speak to ICE agents.  
* Remain calm if you are approached by ICE officers.  
* Always carry with you any valid immigration document.  
* Do not carry false documentation or show any false documentation.  
* // Carry documentation showing presence in the US for more than 2 years.  
* Do not sign anything without speaking with an attorney.  
* You have the right to speak with an attorney; you can tell the agent that you want to speak with an attorney.  
* You have the right to ask for an interpreter.  
* Do not give any false statements to the ICE agent.   
* Keep a Know Your Rights card on your phone.  
* If you see ICE agents outside, try to find a place to go inside.   
* If you witness an ICE raid or see individuals being apprehended and you are able to, document/record what happened.  Do not try to intervene, even if you witness violence or other abuse.

**HOME/OTHER CONSIDERATIONS**

* If ICE agents come to your home, ASK for a warrant. DO NOT open the door if there is no warrant.   
* Request to see the warrant from the window. Do not open the door.   
* You are required to let ICE agents into your home ONLY IF they have a warrant SIGNED BY A JUDGE.  A warrant signed by an ICE supervisor is not good enough.  
* If ICE agents enter your home without your permission, verbally tell them that you never gave consent.    
* Do not answer any questions. You have the right to remain silent.   
* Create a safety plan in case you are apprehended by ICE: 1\) memorize emergency contacts; 2\) know your immigration “A” number and tell your family; 3\) If you have children, have individuals that can care for them; 4\) keep your important documents in a safe place; 5\) make sure your entire household knows the plan.  
* Do not rely on “non attorneys” (including “notarios”) for legal advice.   
* Contact attorneys or non-profit organizations for your legal options.
